About the Project 📝
--------------------

**Target Project**: GitHub Lightning Bounties

We aim to integrate LLMs for analyzing incoming pull requests (PRs) on GitHub. This will cater to various aspects such as security analysis, code quality, and completeness checks. We recognize that LLM API calls have a cost associated, which can escalate with spam PRs. Our solution is a system that employs the Bitcoin Lightning Network to require a small payment for each PR review, thereby filtering spam and covering API costs.

We also believe in rewarding contributors. Hence, payments can be refunded if PRs are accepted, with potential bonuses for merged contributions.
